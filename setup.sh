# This script is used to setup the environment for the CDN application.
# This program does not use any database, so you don't need to create one.
# Only one user will be created, and it will be stored in a file called "settings.yml".

# It will follow the steps below:
# 1. Ask you what environment you want to create.
# 2. Install composer dependencies
# 3. Ask you the credentials for your account.
#    3.1. Ask you the username.
#    3.2. Ask you the password (before storing it, it will be hashed).
# 5. Complete the file "config.php" with the environment you selected.
# 4. Complete the file "settings.yml" with the credentials you provided.

# This script does not use any option, so you can run it with:
# $ bash setup.sh
